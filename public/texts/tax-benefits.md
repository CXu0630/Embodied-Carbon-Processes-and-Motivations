# Tax Benefits
The US tax law as well as state tax laws provide benefits to certain projects that focus on energy efficiency and carbon. Currently, most of these projects focus on operational carbon, which is easier to meter, model, and audit. Reliability and verifiability of data is essential to establish regulations, both qualities of which embodied carbon measurements currently lack. In order for substantial tax incentives to be established for embodied carbon, standardized reporting, third-party verification, and uniform scope definitions need to be established. In speculation of possible directions of tax incentives for embodied carbon, we can first reference existing regulations for operational carbon.

Tax credits often influence investment decisions because many credits created under the Inflation Reduction Act are either transferable or eligible for Direct Pay, enabling entities such as nonprofits and public institutions to receive the credit value as cash.
