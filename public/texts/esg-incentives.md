# ESG Investing Incentives
Research by Giglio et al.[^1] highlights how ESG investing, in addition to its monetary and ethical benefits, motivate investors by providing a way to hedge climate regulations. In the event that jurisdictions adopt stricter climate requirements, ESG-focused projects are more likely to avoid retrofitting or modifying previous plans. ESG funds provide a valuable resiliency tool for investors. This is one reason why EU banks are being encouraged to increase ESG investing (see more about [[211|EU investment disclosure regulations]]).

Giglio et al. also cover other incentives for ESG investing. Monetary returns only motivate 6% of surveyed participants. This is reasonable, since the expected 10-year return on ESG investments is than 2% lower than overall stock market returns. Another 24% are motivated by ethical concerns.

### Renewables
Renewable energy presents an interesting case for ESG investing. Since renewables operate in local energy grids, they provide a second layer of resiliency against fluctuations in climate, regulations, or unexpected events if investments are geographically distributed[^2].
